### Getting started

Only pre-requisity of automated banners setup is to have at least one active data feed in AdBOOST. If you do not have one yet, please follow our [Feed setup guide](/AdBOOST{% post_url 2017-02-01-feed-setup %})

In left context menu choose <i class="fa fa-image">&nbsp;</i> Banners > <i class="fa fa-object-group">&nbsp;</i> Banner sets.<br/>

{% include image_tag.html url="/AdBOOST/images/exports/LeftMenuBanners.png" alt="Left Menu Banners" style="height:200px;" %}

If you have not created any banner set yet, you will be greeted by welcome screen showing preview of banner setup steps and its example result.

If you have already created any banner sets, you will see them in listing and you will have the option to create new one by clicking <span class="btn btn-sm btn-default"><i class="fa fa-plus">&nbsp;</i> Banner set</span> button

{% include image_tag.html url="/AdBOOST/images/exports/BannersListing.png" alt="Banners Listing" style="" %}

Click the <span class="btn btn-sm btn-default"><i class="fa fa-plus">&nbsp;</i> Create your first banner set</span> button and you will be redirected to an empty form with one input for banner set name and another one with selection of your feeds from which you should choose one that will be used as a data source for a banner set. **Both fields are required and you won't be able to change the source feed later in the process**.
