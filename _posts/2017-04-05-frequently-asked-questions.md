## Product Campaigns

**Q: I am satisfied with my AdWords/Bing campaigns. How will AdBOOST help me?**
A: As opposed to a regular campaign which you are likely to have, AdBOOST advertises separately for each particular product (or in general, for each item in your xml feed). This enables you to have large long-tail campaigns for thousands or even hundreds of thousands products with an easy to optimize structure

**Q: Is there a difference between product campaigns created with AdBOOST and product campaigns created manually?**
A: Yes and no. At the end of the day, all campaigns are the same. However, creating manual campaigns will probably take hours of extra work. The main difference is that AdBOOST campaigns are regularly and automatically updated. Hence we can automatically assign new products to advertising and get rid of the old ones. Prices and/or discounts in the ads will also be adjusted automatically

**Q: Can I advertise anything else apart from products?**
A: Yes, of course. It is possible to advertise - for instance on product advice, categories, manufacturers, services or anything else you have to offer

**Q: What kind of budget should I be prepared to invest?**
A: A budget depends individually and should be based on on how frequently your products (or services, tickets, etc) are searched for, the price per click and other such parameters. But keep in mind, that while you are advertising mostly long-tail keywords, CPC's tend to be lower than CPC's of broad keywords

**Q: Can I manage AdBOOST along with my current campaigns?**
A: Of course, it is an ideal combination. By merging AdBOOST campaigns with good-quality regular campaigns you can maximize the number of targeted visitors and thus increase your sales. That applies for AdWords, Bing, Sklik and Facebook dynamic ads as well

**Q: Will I be able to see AdBOOST campaigns in my AdWords/Bing/Sklik accounts?**
A: Yes, you will see your campaigns in the same way as you have always seen them

**Q: Can I edit campaigns in AdWords, Bing or Sklik interface?**
A: You can edit bids, add new keywords and generally do any edits with one exception. You should not create new ads manually in campaigns generated with AdBOOST, because those ads will not be automatically updated by AdBOOST

## The Agency Account

**Q: What is the Agency Account?**
A: The Agency account is equivalent to AdWords MCC account. It allows you to manage multiple AdBOOST accounts with one login email and password. Agency account also consists of detailed user management, so if you have more campaign managers, they will be able to access all AdBOOST accounts they manage. Moreover agency has one master login email with access to all accounts

**Q: Can I create new client accounts in an Agency account?**
A: Yes, you can create any number of client accounts under your agency account. Each new client account will have a 30 day free trial period

Is there anything special I have to do to create an Agency account for my agency?
Nope. The first account that you will sign into via [app.adboost.sk](https://app.adboost.sk/accounts/register/) will automatically become Agency account.
