# Product Campaigns

* TOC
{:toc}

## Getting started

Only pre-requisity of product campaigns setup is to have at least one active data feed in AdBOOST. If you do not have one yet, please follow our [Feed setup guide]({% post_url 2017-02-01-data-feeds %})

## Basic setup

In left context menu choose <i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> Product Campaigns > <i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i> Dashboard or click to large "<i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> Product campaigns" icon <br/> on the main dashboard<br/>

{% include image_tag.html url="/images/campaigns/LeftMenuCampaigns.png" alt="Left Menu Campaigns" style="height:350px;" %}

If you have not created any product campaign yet, you will be greeted by product campaigns dashboard with info message about features that you currently do not use. As you can notice, there are three ways how you can proceed to new campaign addition. Two <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> buttons (one next to the Product Campaigns link and second next to "Campaigns" in left menu) and one **Create your first Campaign** link. All of them will redirect you to the campaign form.
